Fetch Rewards Data Analytic Project

The Attached Files:

JPEG: This images shows the design outlook for my reational database model,and the key aspect is how the datatables coincide with eachother to create unique user that is tagged with each purhcased item (This was the path I took to get the top 100 highest cost items with a unique user ID, receipt ID, product description, and price).


SQL Files: These files present the queries that were used to answer the quesitons for the business stakeholders: What user bought the most expensive item, What is the name of the most expensive item, and How many users scanned in each month?



Excel Files: Present the grids from the queries in originized manner to give viewers the ability to see data presented.



The RMD and PDF File: These files show a graphical representation of the scans per month to see the upward trend in scans throughout the year. Also, one PDF file has my written statement about one of my ovbservation about the data.
